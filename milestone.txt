CS193X Final Project Milestone
==============================

Project Title: College Guidance Guide
Your Name: Jesus Ballesteros
Your SUNetID: jesusb25

Overview
--------
I created a main modules page and tried implementing blogs for lessons but i think im going to compile resources on the links instead and save data in mongoDB plus saved user data
Blockers are how I can connect a backed to the front end

Project Changes
---------------
Definitely going to narrow my scope to just have user data saved on lessons, add an api to save user data and maybe a college listed

Implementation Details
----------------------
added toggle features for buttons and main module page with only html and css. I am using module headers, flex box features, and toggle plus links for classes. Each lesson will have a checkbox to save lesson completions. The api endpoints will save what lessons will be complete

External libraries and code
---------------------------
use the api for server data from the generic social media app and possibly mongodb examples

Collaboration and resources
---------------------------
I have been using a lot of w3schools website and geeks for geeks for css and html help. I have also been using the generic social media app for api help

Anything else?
--------------
How can i connect the backend to the front end? I am having trouble with that
